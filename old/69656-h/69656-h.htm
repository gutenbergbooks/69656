<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>One cannot have moved much in the world without hearing complaints,
both from parents and young persons, about the amount of time and brain
spent in the learning of languages, and the little profit derived from
this outlay. These complaints, no doubt, arise partly from the want
of judgment on the part of the parents, and the want of capacity and
inclination on the part of their young hopefuls: parents often acting
thoughtlessly on the vulgar notion that far birds have fair feathers,
and preferring what is foreign to what is native, and what lies at a
great distance in time or space to what is near; and young persons
being forced to submit themselves to a grammatical indoctrination in
which they feel no interest, and from which they derive no benefit.
But it is no less true that these complaints are due in no small
measure to false methods of linguistic training generally, or to some
cherished prejudices in favour of certain languages on the part of the
teachers; and it becomes therefore, at the present day, a matter of
great practical importance to inquire how far our traditional methods
of teaching languages are in conformity with the method of Nature in
her great art of thought-utterance, and how far they may justly be
called on to submit themselves to a revision and a reconstitution. We
say at the present day emphatically, because it is quite evident that
education, following in the train of democratic reform, is one of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
watchwords of the hour, to which every good citizen must lend an
obedient ear; and not only so, but circumstances have so changed since
our schooling received its traditional form, that the wants which were
satisfied by our school curriculum and school practice in the days
of Milton and Locke now demand an altogether different treatment. In
particular, the so-called learned languages, two hundred years ago the
only medium of culture to an accomplished English gentleman, have now
become the luxury of the leisurely, or the arsenal of the professional
few, while other languages, such as German, not named in those days,
are now sought after as the keys to the most valuable storehouses of
all sorts of knowledge. Add to this that Great Britain, which was then
a secondary naval power, and following the French and the Spaniards
slowly in the great world-transforming process of colonisation, is now
mistress of a world-wide empire from the Ganges to Vancouver Isle,
through which stretch she exercises a dominant influence, combining
the political virtue of ancient Rome with the commercial activity of
Carthage. In these circumstances it becomes the special duty of every
British man to acquire a familiar knowledge of the languages of the
various races with which he may be brought into political or commercial
relations; and, as languages after all are not valuable in themselves,
but only as tools by which effective work in certain fields falls to
be performed, we ought to see to it, both that we get the proper tools
for doing the work, and that we learn to use them in such fashion as to
work pleasantly and profitably; and in this view it may be truly said
that, while the wrong language in the wrong place is of no use at all,
even the right language in the right place, when imperfectly learned,
is a tool with which the best workman can do only bad work, and perhaps
cut his own fingers in the process.</p>

<p>As language is a function which belongs as much to every normal human
creature as seeing or hearing, there can be no difficulty in finding
out the method of Nature in its acquisition. We have to answer only two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
questions: first, What are the factors of the process by which the
human babe, from being capable merely of inarticulate cries, like
any of the lower animals, is developed into an easy and graceful
manipulator of articulate speech? and again, How far, and in what
respects, does this model require to be modified in order to enable
the expert handlers of the mother tongue to use any second or third
language with like expertness? That this cannot be a very difficult
matter demands no far-sought induction to prove, as the fact lies
before us; for from the Greeks in the South-East to the Highlanders
in the North-West we find bilingual and trilingual peoples largely
scattered over Europe. It is in fact as easy to learn two or three
languages as to learn one, if only the learner be habitually submitted
to the natural influences, and guided by the steps of a natural process.</p>

<p>What then, in the first place, are the steps of the process which
analysis presents as elevating the inarticulate babe to the
significant-speaking boy or girl? There is (1) the direct connection
of certain objects with certain sounds and gestures; (2) these objects
are such as stand in the nearest relation to the learner, and are
presented to him in an atmosphere of the most natural and most pleasant
surroundings; (3) the imitative faculty, by which he appropriates the
proper sounds, is encouraged and cherished by frequent repetition, till
the original impression becomes permanently stamped into his soul,
and, so to speak, jumps up spontaneously with the object. Let us, in
the next place, ask how far this child’s linguistic ladder is affected
by the performer being an adult. Manifestly the difference lies only
in one point, and that altogether in favour of the adult, viz. the
application of a regulated system to the accidental sequences by which
the child learns its mother tongue, easily indeed and pleasantly, but
slowly; for he learns not architecturally as a mason builds a house,
but by the way, as one picks up a pebble on the shore or a daisy from
the meadow; whereas the adult, with his firm will and his reasonable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
purpose, wishing to learn a language can submit himself to a reasonable
and a calculated treatment; and in so doing experience has shown that
in favourable circumstances, and under wise training, he can learn a
foreign language more perfectly in six months than a child can do in
as many years. Why then, you ask, is this not always done? Why does it
seem such a difficult business to acquire a familiar knowledge of any
foreign language, and why is so much brain and so much time spent so
frequently on their acquisition with such scanty results? The answer
can be only one: because your teacher has ignored the method of Nature,
and given you a bad substitute for it in his own devices; instead of
speaking to you and making you respond, in direct connection of the old
object with the new sound, and thus forming a living bond between the
thinking soul, the perceptive sense, and the significant utterance,
he sends you to a book, there to cram yourself with dead rules and
lifeless formulas about the language, in the middle of which he ought
to have planted you at the start. The evil results of this neglect of
the living model of Nature are only too manifest. Books are useful, but
they are only secondary; in all matters of observation and practical
exercise they may form an apt accompaniment or a supplement, but they
never can supplant the vital function of which they are only the dead
record. No one learns dancing, or fencing, or golf, or lawn-tennis
from a book. The evils caused by this unnatural delegation of the work
of a living teacher to the formulas of a dead book are three: (1) The
direct connection between the reasonable soul and the new articulate
sign of the object is lost; the learner does not shake hands, so to
speak, with the object, but he cumbers himself with the phraseology of
his mother tongue, and instead of saying at once δός μοι ἄρτον, <i>give
me bread</i>, he must first ask what is <i>the Greek for bread</i>. In
this way the new term remains a stranger to his thought, and he uses it
uncomfortably, as when a man puts on a pair of shoes which have only an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
occasional acquaintance with his feet. (2) Then again, when, after
being sufficiently tortured with mere grammatical forms, he acquires a
certain vocabulary from the elementary reading books, the objects for
which this vocabulary supplies the new names are seldom the objects
with which he is familiarly surrounded and in which he has a living
interest, but they relate to something Julius Cæsar did in Gaul or
Cicero said in Rome some 2000 years ago, a region of strange sounds,
in which the linguistic neophyte of this nineteenth century has no
particular inclination to move, and to which his memory cannot ally
itself with any feeling of kinship; and he easily forgets the word,
because he does not care for the thing. But (3) even when he does care
for the thing, the mere reading of a lesson every day does not in the
least ensure that frequent repetition of a new vocable in connection
with an object, on which the familiar knowledge of a language depends;
whereas, if the teacher had commenced by making his schoolroom an
echo-chamber of daily repeated sounds in connection with interesting
and familiar objects directly in the view of the learner or near to
his daily life, familiarity with a new language, be it Greek or be
it German, would come as naturally and as pleasantly to a clever lad
of seventeen as the use of the mother tongue to a dainty girl or a
rattling boy of seven.</p>

<p>These things being so, and the method of Nature being so plain in the
matter, we now ask what are the causes that have led so many of our
teachers, even the most accomplished of their class, to neglect so
infallible a guide, and to follow methods of linguistic inculcation
equally unpleasant in the process and unprofitable in the result? These
causes, fortunately, are as patent as the consequences to which they
have led. The first cause is ignorance. In not a few of our educational
institutions it is to be feared there are teachers—an over-worked and
under-paid class—who are employed to teach languages of which they
have only a very superficial knowledge and no firm hold. With persons
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
of this class the whole process of linguistic training amounts to this,
<i>Read your book, Get your lesson, and I will hear you</i>. Of a
living appeal from the tongue of the teacher and a living response from
the tongue of the learner these gentlemen have no conception. They must
do the most they can, confine themselves within page and chapter of a
printed book, where they require no knowledge beyond the marked limits
of the lesson, and where the scantiness of their linguistic furniture
and the feebleness of their linguistic vitality cannot be exposed.
Let them pass. But what of the men of high accomplishment, exact
scholarship, and fine taste: why should they scorn the practice which
is the foundation of the rules, and the conversation which made great
speeches and great poems before rules or schools were heard of? Simply
because they have forgotten the lesson taught in a well-known dialogue
of Plato,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
that the printed papers which we call books, useful for
record, are rather prejudicial than profitable to the culture of
memory; they have become the slaves of their tools, and defrauded the
ear and the tongue of their natural rights in the field of significant
speech by a wholesale transference of their functions to the eyes. The
scholar, in their conception, is a reading animal, and without books
he is nowhere. Why then, they will argue, when our object is to read
and to understand books, should we trouble ourselves with conversation?
We do not learn Latin in order to talk with Cæsar and Cicero, but to
read their books; and in like manner we do not study German to drink
beer and smoke pipes and sing songs with rollicking students in a
<i>kneipe</i>, but to ponder with many-sided thought over the poems of
Goethe or the speculations of Hegel. So be it. Let books and not living
converse be the final end of the study of languages; so they certainly
are with the dead languages; but even with regard to them it is quite
certain that the familiarity and frequent repetition which are the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
special virtues of the conversational method both render the mastery of
books, as in the case of the mother tongue, more complete, and the hold
of the printed signature at once more firm in the grasp and more easy
in the approach. But some one will say, Does not speaking in a language
imply thinking in it, and is not thinking in a foreign tongue one of
the most difficult and rare attainments even with the most accomplished
linguists? Not at all. The difficulty lies merely in starting from
the wrong end and following the false direction thus given till it
culminates in the persistency of a bad habit and the imagination of
an impossibility. It is as easy to look the Sun in the face and say
שׁמּשּׁ, <span class="smcap">Shemish</span>, as to say <span class="smcap">Sun</span>,
and there is no more difficulty in saying λαβὼν τὸ σκάλευθρον κίνει
τὸ πῦρ, than in saying, <i>take the poker and stir the fire</i>. In
both cases the direct connection of <i>thought</i>, <i>thing</i>, and
<i>word</i> is equally obvious, equally easy, and equally natural; only
at the start the habit of thinking exclusively in the mother tongue
must be broken.</p>

<p>There is one other objection to the conversational method in the
teaching of languages, viz. that it makes a man a parrot. Well, a
parrot is an imitative animal, and so is a man, and so far must not be
ashamed to own his kinship with the plumy prattler. But he is a parrot
and something more; and this something more every sensible teacher will
take into account. For myself, I have no preference for random talk:
my contention is for regulated talk; the talk first and the regulation
afterwards, in the order of gradation so succinctly stated by Lord
Bacon—<i>speaking makes a ready man, reading makes a full man, writing
makes an accurate man</i>;—all the three. But have your nails first
before you pare them; this is the common sense of the matter.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I have a word or two to say with regard to the occasion
and the plan of this little book. In the first place, whatever may
be said of Hebrew or Latin, Greek is a living language, and must be
treated as such even by those who persist in the notion that, while the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
method of living vocal appeal applies in its full extent to modern
languages, it is certainly out of place in the treatment of the
two ancient languages which justly claim the first place in the
linguistic culture of our highest schools. The delusion that Greek
is a dead language, springing as it does mainly out of our “insular
ignorance,” as Professor Seeley calls it, and partly, I fear, our
national insolence, will be dispelled in a moment by a glance at any
current Greek newspaper; as for instance the following paragraph, the
first that met my eye, from the 2d November number of the Athenian
“Ἀκρόπολις,” giving a short notice of the application of Koch’s remedy
for consumption.</p>

</div>

<p>Any person who can read classical Greek without a dictionary will have
no difficulty in understanding this passage; and, if he is familiar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>
with the New Testament in the original, he will find that some of the
principal peculiarities which distinguish the Greek used by the living
political and public men of Athens, so far from being corruptions, are
no less distinctive features of the κοινὴ διάλεκτος of the Greeks now
than they were in the days of the Apostle Paul and the Evangelist John.
But this is not all. It requires only a superficial acquaintance with
the most patent facts of Greek literature to know that some of the
most popular and the most profound teachers of Greek wisdom—Plato,
Aristophanes and Xenophon—use the conversational style. The Greeks,
in fact, were, as they are still, a lively and a talking people, and
Socrates, their greatest name, cannot be better described than as a
talking street preacher of reason and common sense. Well, then, on this
double basis that Greek is a living language, and that the colloquial
style is that in which its highest and best thoughts are expressed;
and knowing, moreover, by large experience, that the most effective
way to get a firm grasp of any language is to begin by speaking it,
some twenty years ago I published a small volume of Greek and English
dialogues,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
which I used in my class in as far as it was possible to do so in
such a multitudinous huddlement of untrained lads as the Scottish
Universities, contrary to the practice of all educated nations, admit
into the junior classes of the Faculty of Arts. The little book
came to a second edition; but that it was in anywise generally used
by classical teachers I have no reason to believe, partly because,
of all classes of men, teachers are the most closely wedded to old
bookish habits, and partly because Scotland is not a country to which
the world, governed as it is by authority and by names, would look
for anything worthy of imitation in the Greek line: “<i>Can any good
thing come out of Nazareth?</i>” This, as the world goes, was quite
legitimate, and gave me no concern. But since that time, as a natural
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>
consequence of the great educational movement of the age, some very
distinct voices have come to my ear, to the effect that there is
something radically wrong in our way of dealing with languages, and
that the method of teaching by rules and grammar mainly can no longer
be tolerated. I therefore felt it my duty to appeal a second time to
the public and to teachers on this important matter, the more so that
my little book stood too far apart from the educational attitude of
the teachers, and, if it was to find its way into general school use,
required a more elementary book as an introduction. This elementary
book I now send forth under the title of a <i>Greek Primer, Colloquial
and Constructive</i>, indicating by this title that the lessons in
talking go hand in hand with the grammatical forms naturally educed
from them, each lesson being regulated talk, according to a natural
progression from the more simple to the more complex forms in ordinary
use. This progressive incorporation of the grammar is the feature which
distinguishes the lessons of this introductory book from the dialogues
in its predecessor; and the necessity of having constant reference to
grammatical forms prevented me from giving that unity of subject to the
dialogue as dialogue which belonged to the previous volume.</p>

<p>I have only further to state, with regard to the use of this little
primer in the hands of a teacher, that I have no desire that he should
bind himself slavishly to the text. The scraps of talk that are given
under each lesson are meant to lend him a helping hand in the use
of a new organ; and, to enable both teacher and learner to furnish
themselves with a living vocabulary of Greek words in direct connection
with their daily surroundings, I have added an alphabetical list of the
names of the most familiar objects that belong to the field of life
in town or country where the learner may happen to be. When the young
Hellenist has stamped its Greek designation directly on every object
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</span>
that meets his eyes, and connected it with some single verb that
belongs to its significance in familiar life, I would then suggest that
the teacher, besides the daily repetition of certain forms of common
conversation, should give a <i>vivâ voce</i> description of pictures
hung on the wall two or three times a week, which the learner shall
be called on to repeat without any written notes; the principle of
the method being always to maintain the direct action of the mind on
the object, through the instrumentality of the new sound, without the
intervention of the mother tongue. As to when, and how far, and in what
kind the usual furniture of elementary books of grammar, reading, and
exercises should go parallel with colloquial practice, this I leave
altogether in the hands of the practised teacher, being well assured
that easy reading and accurate writing, so far from being inconsistent
with, are the natural blossom and the ripe fruit of the root of living
utterance from which I start.</p>

<p>One other matter requires special notice—a matter not necessarily
connected with the colloquial method, but which may be wisely used as
a help. To each lesson I have appended a short list of English words,
either by family affinity, or by direct borrowing, or by indirect
borrowing through the Latin, radically identical with the Greek. The
habit of identifying such words under an English disguise will perform
the double function of facilitating memory and giving a lesson on the
transmutation of sounds and meaning, the tracing of which gives so
peculiar a charm to comparative philology. In <a href="#APPENDIX_I">Appendix I</a>.
I have added some of the principles on which these transmutations
depend, so far as they are suggested by the words used in the text.</p>

<p>But what of the pronunciation? After what has been shown of the living
continuity of the Greek tongue, from Byzantium downwards to the present
day, there cannot be the slightest doubt that Greek orthoepy should be
treated in the same fashion that the orthoepy of French, German, or any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span>
other living tongue is treated. The pronunciation is ruled by the
practice of the present, not by philological facts or fancies as to the
pronunciation of the past. No doubt, as Heraclitus says, πάντα ῥεῖ,
<i>all things flow</i>, as in the universe, so in language, there is
no fixation—there is always change. But the changes which take place
in living languages, like English or Greek, are of a very different
kind from those which take place when a language like Latin becomes
dead, and rises to a new life in the form of such specific varieties
as Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese. They are of the nature of a
normal growth, and are at all events only exaggerations or expansions
of a native tendency. To such exaggerations every spoken language is
subject, and few more than our insular English, as any one may see who
will compare the accentuation of English in the time of Chaucer with
the orthoepy of the present hour. But in respect of accents at least
Greek has been far more conservative than English, so much so indeed
that the accentual marks placed on Greek words by the Alexandrian
grammarians two hundred and fifty years before Christ, in the practice
of the Greek Church and the Greek people still indicate the same
dominance of voice on the accented syllable that the Athenian ear
recognised as classic in the orations of Demosthenes and the apostolic
eloquence of St. Paul. There can therefore be no greater barbarism than
to disown this legitimate music of Greek speech, as is done both in
England and Scotland, when we pronounce ἀγαθὸς ὁ θεός, like Latin or
English, ἄγαθος ὁ θέος; not to mention the staring absurdity and loss
of brain implied in the practice of the great English schools of first
pronouncing the word with a false accentuation, and then stultifying
the daily practice of the ear by learning a rule to say where the
accent ought to have been placed! Nothing could more distinctly show
the falseness of our habit of flinging the burden of learning languages
on formulas of the understanding and leaving the living organ of
linguistic practice altogether out of account. Therefore, by all means,
either drop the accents out of the grammar, or use them whenever you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</span>
give the written word voice in the air. As to the quantity of the
vowels, which is the stumbling block with most English scholars,
we have no lack of words, even in our own unmusical English, such
as <i>lándholder</i>, in which, as in the Greek ἄνθρωπος, the
antepenultimate has the rising inflexion, while the penult is long;
and if the modern Greeks pronounce ἄνθρωπος as if written ἄνθροπος,
that is only a natural curtailment of the unaccented syllable which
lies in the nature of human speech, and will be found exemplified
more or less in all languages. As to the vocal value of the separate
vowels and consonants, this, no doubt, is a point in some cases of
considerable difficulty; but it is quite certain that <i>a</i>, both
in Latin and Greek, has the broad sound as in Italian and Scotch, not
the sound of the English in <i>pātent</i>, that ι is the most slender
of the vowel sounds, not the broad semi-diphthongal sound of the
English in <i>prime</i> or <i>sigh</i>, that ου has the soft sound of
<i>oo</i> in <i>boom</i>, not the <i>bow-wow</i> sound of <i>ou</i>
as in <i>howl</i>; also that αι in all probability was pronounced
as in the English <i>vain</i>, not as in the German <i>Kaiser</i>.
On the whole matter of pronunciation, however, the English scholar
should bear in mind that the poetry of the ancients was composed on
musical principles, with a strict regard to the quantitative value
of the vowel on which the rhythmical accent fell, a practice which
necessarily caused the spoken accent to be dropped in verse, or very
much subordinated; and again, if his ear should happen to be very much
offended by the predominance of the slender sound of ι in the familiar
πολυφλοίσβοιο θαλάσσης of Homer, there is no reason why he should not
adopt a special vocalisation for the reading of the Greek poets, just
as we in our reading of Chaucer must constantly put a final accent on
words that, if applied to the spoken tongue, would render the speaker
either ridiculous or unintelligible. But in whatever fashion the
teacher of Greek in this country may choose to settle this delicate
point, the matter of pronunciation has nothing radically to do with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</span>
great principle of linguistic practice which this little book
inculcates. To start with the practice of speaking will facilitate
the acquisition of a new language under any system of pronunciation;
only this must distinctly be said, that the scholar who has learned to
read Greek with a vocalisation and an accentuation invented by himself
for himself has deliberately cut himself off from all intelligible
communion with the people whose literary tradition he values so highly,
and with whom to maintain a familiar intercourse, both in a political
and a literary point of view, should be no secondary consideration with
the wise.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I have great pleasure in returning thanks to the learned
Hellenists who kindly undertook the task of revising the proofs of
this little work as they came from the press, viz. Mr. Hardie, Balliol
College, Oxford; Principal Geddes, Aberdeen; Principal Donaldson, St.
Andrews; and Mr. Gardiner, Edinburgh Academy; and if I have not in
every instance taken advantage of their suggestions, it is because on
principle I have no sympathy with the nice sensibility which refuses
the stamp of classicality to all forms and idioms unsanctioned by the
usage of Attic writers, preferring to float my skiff freely on the
great Catholic Greek of all ages, from Plato to Polybius, from Polybius
to Chrysostom, and from Chrysostom to Thereianos and Paspati.</p>

</div>

<p>The Greek letters, borrowed as they were from the East and adopted by
the Romans, are substantially the same as the Roman letters of our
common English usage, and in fact differ from them both in figure and
power scarcely more than our present English type differs from the old
English black letter or the common German type. A few remarks will
suffice to show where or how far the pronunciation varies from our
English use of the same letters.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">NOTES</h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">Α is always the broad <i>a</i> (=ah)
of all European languages, and never softened down to the English
<i>ā</i>, as heard in <i>pātent</i>, <i>nátion</i>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Β in the spoken Greek of the present day is
softened down to the cognate <i>v</i>, exactly as in Gaelic <i>b</i>
with the <i>h</i> appended becomes <i>v</i>, as <i>ban</i>, fair, with
<i>h</i>, <i>bhan</i> = <i>van</i>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Γ, when followed by the broad vowels <i>a</i>
and <i>o</i>, is pronounced hard as in English and Gaelic; but when
followed by soft vowels the <i>Greeks</i> now give it the sound of
the English <i>y</i> in <i>yes</i>, <i>yellow</i>—γέλως, γέρων,—just
as in German the <i>g</i> in the third syllable of <i>Göttingen</i>
is so softened down as almost to disappear.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
This euphonic action of a weak vowel upon a strong consonant preceding
is natural and found in most languages; exactly as the Italians in
their soft dialect of Latin have changed Κικέρων into <i>Chichero</i>,
<i>ch</i> being pronounced as in the English <i>church</i>.</p>

<p class="big_indent">Before κ, γ, χ and ξ, the letter γ has the
sound of <i>n</i>, as in ἄγγελος, in Latin <i>angelus</i>, English
<i>angel</i>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Δ, or D, is in like manner softened into
<i>th</i> as in the English <i>mother</i>; thus δέν <i>not</i>, from
οὐδέν, pronounced οὐθέν.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Ε is our short <i>e</i>, as in <i>get</i>; never
long <i>ē</i>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Η, or ἦτα, was in ancient times always a long
<i>ē</i>, English <i>ā</i> as in <i>gate</i>; now it is always
<i>ee</i> as in <i>seem</i> or <i>theme</i>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Θ is the English <i>th</i>, as in <i>mouth</i>,
<i>south</i>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Ι is always the slender English <i>ee</i>, either
short as in <i>peep</i> or long as in <i>scēne</i>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Ξ is <i>ks</i>, <i>gs</i>, contracted into
<i>x</i>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Υ, from which our <i>y</i> came, was in ancient
times identical with the delicate <i>ü</i>, <i>ue</i>, of the Germans,
halfway between οὐ = <i>oo</i> and <i>ee</i>, into which in the living
language it is always softened, exactly as in some parts of Germany
<i>Brüder</i> is pronounced <i>Brēēder</i>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Χ is an aspirated <i>k</i>, but pronounced like
<i>milch</i> in German or <i>loch</i> in Scotch, which the English, who
do not possess this beautiful soft guttural, generally sharpen into a
<i>k</i>, as in <i>lake</i>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Ω, omega, as the name indicates, is simply a long
<i>o</i>, as in πῶλος, <i>a foal</i>.</p>

<p>For the English <i>h</i> the Greeks used a simple mark of aspiration
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
turned to the right thus, ἱερός <i>sacred</i>, pronounced
<i>hee-er-ŏs</i>, while the same mark turned to the left, as in ἔρως,
simply signifies the absence of the <i>h</i>. Whether this <i>spiritus
lenis</i>, as it is called, was put on the initial vowel to indicate
the presence of an original <i>h</i> which had vanished, I cannot
say; but one can readily fancy that if the Cockney fashion of calling
Highgate <i>Igate</i> were to become general, every such curtailed word
might receive a mark thus, <i>’igate</i>, as the survival of a lost
breathing.</p>

<p>Besides the vowels in the alphabet we find in Greek, as in other
languages, compound vowel sounds called diphthongs. They are seven—αι,
ει, οι, αυ, υι, ευ and ου. Their ancient pronunciation is very
difficult to expiscate, and in them we note the partiality of the
Greeks for the slender sound of <i>ee</i>, called by a Latin writer
<i>gracilitas</i>, and by modern scholars <i>itacism</i>. This tendency
has wiped off the diphthongal character altogether from οι, υι, and
ει, which are all pronounced like a single ι, English <i>ee</i>. To
balance this, αι becomes the English <i>ai</i>, as in <i>vain</i>; ου
retains its full soft roundness as in <i>gloom</i>; while in αυ and ευ
in the living Greek the υ has assumed a consonantal value and become
<i>v</i>, from which usage the εὐαγγέλιον of the Gospels has become
the <i>evangelium</i> of the Latin Church, and the <i>evangel</i>
of English; so αὐλός, <i>a flute</i>, is pronounced <i>avlóss</i>,
and this <i>v</i> is aspirated into the kindred <i>ƒ</i>, when the
following consonant is κ, π, τ, θ, χ, ξ, σ, or ψ, as in αὐτός,
<i>aftos</i>, εὔξεινος, <i>efxeinos</i>. That the ancients, at least
in poetry, did not do this is evident from the full diphthongal value
of a long sound given to the εὐ in εὐαγής and such-like words by the
dramatic writers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ACCENTUATION AND QUANTITY</h2>
</div>

<p>In respect of accentuation the Greek language has the advantage above
most others that, while in Latin, English, or German the proper
intonation of a word in doubtful cases can only be known by an appeal
to a dictionary or to an authoritative speaker, in Greek every word
in a book, as it stands before the eye, exhibits and perpetuates the
tonic relation of the syllables to one another. The student has but
to observe the rise or fall of the syllables on his page as he would
do the notes in a piece of music, and he cannot go wrong. Only a few
characteristic points require to be laid down to make the principle on
which the practice depends intelligible.</p>

<p>The word <i>accent</i>, taken from the Latin grammarians, evidently
signifies a certain music of speech, a singing to or with (<i>ad</i>
and <i>cano</i>) an articulate word; while the expression used
by the Greek grammarians, τόνος from τείνω, indicates a stretch,
stress, or intension of the voice on the syllable so affected. Taking
these two elements together we see that a Greek word, say καλός,
<i>beautiful</i>, with the mark of the acute accent on the last
syllable—hence called oxytone, from ὀξύς, <i>sharp</i>—is pronounced
with an elevation of the voice, which brings along with it a dominance
of the syllable on which it stands above the other syllables with which
it is connected. It stands to reason that after such a dominance given
to one syllable the voice, if there be a subsequent syllable, will
fall; and so, as in πραγμάτων, the final syllable will be pronounced in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
a lower tone which is called grave. In the general use this lower-toned
syllable requires no special mark, being sufficiently indicated by
its necessary subservience to the accented syllable; with the Greeks,
however, it seems to have been the practice to pronounce an oxytone
word, when it occurs in the middle of a sentence, in a lower tone than
at the end, and so the word καλός in the middle of a sentence, as in
καλὴ παρθένος, is marked with a grave accent from left to right instead
of from right to left; but this, though it lowers the tone, does not
affect the dominance of the syllable. It is just as if in music the
same note, with the same rhythmical dominance, were sung an octave
lower. Practically, the learner need not concern himself curiously
about the matter.</p>

<p>It is a rule, both in Greek and Latin, that no word can be accented
farther back than the third syllable from the end, the antepenultimate,
the favourite accent of the English language. But, while this rule,
in a musical point of view, preserves the language from such a rattle
of insignificant sounds as in <i>lámentable</i>, <i>mílitary</i>,
and not a few other quadrisyllables in our unmusical English tongue,
it manifestly requires a correction from the side of penultimate and
oxytone accentuation to achieve the just balance of the music of
speech. In this respect Greek is decidedly superior to both Latin and
English; for, while Latin rejects the sonorous cadence of the accent
on the last syllable altogether, English uses it only in some verbs,
remnants of the past participle of Latin verbs, as in <i>rejéct</i>,
<i>suppóse</i>, <i>accépt</i>, and such-like; and in the case of the
penult the fine swelling cadence of the Greek words, in which the acute
accent of the penult is followed by a final long syllable, altogether
fails, as in πραγμάτων, which an Englishman, following his English ear,
will pronounce not only πράγματων but πράγματον, as if ω were ο. The
student, therefore, will carefully train his ear to give all oxytone
words their full value, and never to say ἄγαθος ὁ θέος instead of
ἀγαθὸς ὁ θεός, or κάλος ὁ ἄνηρ for καλὸς ὁ ἀνήρ.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>By the quantity of a word we mean the comparative duration of the
sound, exactly as in music a<br /> <img src="images/minim.jpg" alt="" width="20" height="42" />
<big>is related to a</big> <img src="images/quaver.jpg" alt="" width="23" height="42" /><big>;</big><br />
and in Greek the accentuation stands in a very marked relation
to the quantity of the syllables, which in practice asserts itself
prominently as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><b>(1)</b> It is an invariable condition of the antepenultimate
accent that the last syllable be short, as in ἄνθρωπος, a man; and in
consequence,</p>

<p><b>(2)</b> If in the course of flexion a word with an
antepenultimate accent takes a long final vowel, as in the genitive
and dative singular of the second declension, the accent of the first
syllable is advanced to the penult, as in ἀνθρώπου.</p>

<p><b>(3)</b> The converse takes place in verbs, where the accent is
naturally on the root, as in λέγω, of which the imperfect is ἔλεγον;
but in the aor. mid. indic., while the third person is ἐλέξατο, the
first person is not ἐλέξαμην, but ἐλεξάμην.</p>
</div>

<p>A long syllable of course, as in προφήτης, may have an acute accent
on a long vowel with the same right as a short syllable; but there
are many long syllables in Greek which are marked neither with an
acute nor a grave but with a circumflex, which is a prolonged accent
compounded of a rise and a fall marked thus <big><big>^,</big></big> or
for greater ease, <big><big>~</big></big>. These words are generally
compounds of which the elements are quite plain, as in φιλοῦσι for
φιλέουσι, τιμῶσι for τιμάουσι; in other words, as in σῶμα, a body,
or the genitive plural of the first declension, as πολιτῶν, and some
others, the single elements from which the complex tone arose were
either historically known to the grammarians or legitimately assumed.
At all events, every syllable in Greek with a circumflex accent is
practically treated as if it had two accents; σῶμα as if it were σάὸμα,
χρῶμα as χρόὰμα, πρᾶγμα as if it were πράὰγμα, and so on. It follows
from this, and the principle that no word can be accented farther back
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
than the antepenultimate, that, if in the
course of flexion a word with a circumflex on the penult receives
an additional syllable so as to become, in accentual value, a
quadrisyllable, the accent must be advanced; thus from τιμῶμαι,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
I am honoured, we can say τιμᾶσθε in the second person plural, but we
cannot say τιμῶμεθα, so must say τιμώμεθα. The change of accentual
marking in this instance is of no practical value to the student, but
in the case of enclitics, of which we shall now speak, it affects the
ear most decidedly.</p>

<p>Enclitics are small words, which, so to speak, have not force enough
to stand on their own legs, but lean (ἐγκλίνω) on the weightier word
that precedes them for support, and become absorbed in it; just as
in English we say <i>don’t</i> for <i>do not</i>, and in Italian
<i>dimmi</i> for the Latin <i>dic mihi</i>. These enclitics are πού,
ποτέ, γε, and a few others, the oblique cases of the personal pronouns,
the indefinite pronoun τις, and the verbs εἰμί, <i>I am</i>, φημί, <i>I
say</i>, except in the second person singular. The effect of their
being thus taken up by the previous word and forming a new whole must,
in not a few cases, materially affect the position of the accent;
for, while in καλός τις, <i>a certain good-looking fellow</i>, there
is no change in the intonation of καλός to the ear, the moment I say
κάλλιστος τις, I either violate the rule which forbids the accent
on the fourth syllable from the end, or I keep to the rule and say
κάλλιστός τις. In the same way when I say ὁ διάβολος, <i>the devil</i>,
simply, I preserve the antepenultimate accent with full effect in
its natural place; but if I apply the reproachful term to a special
person, and say, as in John vi. 70, ἐξ ὑμῶν εἷς διάβολός ἐστιν, <i>one
of you is a devil</i>, I immediately, to give the ἐστιν something to
lean on, must make the διάβολος oxytone. Similarly, I cannot write
πνεῦμα ἔστιν, which in accentual value would be a compound word of five
syllables, but I must say πνεῦμά ἐστι (John vi. 63), when the last
syllable of the supporting word with the two syllables of the enclitic
become accentually a new word of three syllables with a legitimate
antepenultimate accent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>If the position of the accent, a point often not a little troublesome
even to natives in the orthoepy of their own language, has been
relieved of all practical difficulty by the curious prevision of
the Alexandrian elders, the quantity is even more simple. With the
double aid of the two separate signs for long vowels, η and ω, and
the quantity of the final vowel as determined by its relation to the
previous accented syllables, the only difficulty that remains is
obviated by the mark ¯ over the long vowels, and the ◡ over the short
ones found in all good dictionaries. In the present little work it
will be sufficient to mark the long vowel where it occurs in doubtful
cases, and leave the short ones to be understood as short from the
absence of the long mark. But the real difficulty that prevents both
accent and quantity from being easily acquired by English scholars
is the negligent practice of transferring Latin or English habits
of accentuation to Greek words, as when θεός is pronounced like
<i>Déus</i>, and Σωκράτης as <i>Sócrates</i>, and again the supposition
that the accent cannot be put on a syllable without making it long,
or removed without making it short. Let only the honest attempt be
made to pronounce ἄνθρωπος, not as <i>anthroāpos</i>, but as in
<i>lándhōlder</i>, <i>córndēaler</i>, and other such words, and the α
in Σωκράτης, not like <i>a</i> in <i>claw</i> or <i>maw</i>, but like
the <i>a</i> in <i>lattice</i> and <i>scatter</i>, and the difficulty
will vanish like the gleam of a mirage before the firm foot and the
cool eye of the traveller.</p>

<p>A noun is the name of a thing or person, a verb signifies an action, an
adjective a quality as good or bad belonging to a noun. The nominative
case is the person who is or may be doing what the verb means; the
objective case is the thing or person to which or towards which the
action of the verb tends. The verb <i>to be</i>, denoting simple
existence, not action, of course is followed by the nominative, not the
objective case.</p>

<p>Nouns are masculine, feminine, or neuter.</p>

<div class="blockquot fontsize_110">
<p>Masculines generally end in ος.</p>
<p>Feminines in η or α, a few in ος—ὁδός, <i>a way</i>,</p>
<p class="big_indent">βίβλος, <i>a book</i>, παρθένος, <i>a maiden</i>.</p>
<p>Neuters in ον.</p>
</div>

<p>The objective case ends in ν, the ν being added to the termination of
feminines, and substituted for the ς in masculines. In neuters the
nominative and objective are the same. Adjectives follow the same rule.

<p>The relative pronoun, <big>ὅς, ἥ, ὅ</big>, <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, is declined

παῖς, <i>a boy</i>—παιδίον, <i>a little boy</i>; βρέφος, <i>a

<p class="f120 space-below1"><span class="smcap">Third Declension, Singular</span></p>

<p>The third declension of nouns in Greek is more rich and varied than the
other two, and, besides, is distinguished by a peculiarity from which
the others are free, viz. while in the first and second declensions all
that requires to be done in forming the cases is to change the last
syllable of the nominative commencing with a vowel, leaving the main
body of the word unchanged, as ἡμέρα,-ας, ἄργυρ-ος,-ου, in the third
we observe that the final consonant of the root seems in many cases to
have been assimilated or absorbed by the termination of the nominative,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
and reappears in the other cases, as in ἐλπίς, genitive ἐλπίδος.
Sometimes also the vowel of the last syllable of the nominative is
shortened before the addition of the genitival termination, as in
ποιμήν, ποιμένος. In some classes of nouns no change is made, and
the analogy of the two other declensions is followed throughout. We
shall take our examples from the more simple classes, leaving the more
complex and exceptional to be learned in the course of reading.</p>

<p>The general type is—</p>

<i>a storm</i>; φλέψ, φλεβός, <i>a vein</i>; Κύκλωψ,-ωπος, <i>a

π or β before the case termination. In the same way nouns in ξ = κς or

<p class="no-indent">as ποιμήν, ποιμένες, λαῖλαψ, λαίλαπες, following
always the type of the genitive singular, as πατέρες, not πατρές;
but ἀνήρ has ἄνδρες, not ἀνέρες. Only in the dative plural the final
consonant ν, δ, or τ is dropped before the σι of the dative, as
ποιμέσι, <i>to shepherds</i>; στόμασι, <i>to mouths</i>; λαμπάσι, <i>to
torches</i>.</p>

<p>The adjective πᾶς, πᾶσα, πᾶν follows this rule, having παντός in
the genitive, but πᾶσι in dative plural; so γίγας, <i>a giant</i>;
γίγαντος, <i>of a giant</i>; but γιγᾶσι, <i>to giants</i>.</p>

<p class="f120 space-below1"><span class="smcap">The Future Active</span></p>

<p>The characteristic letter of the future tense is σ, inserted before
the terminations that mark the persons, thus: λύω, <i>I loosen</i>;
λύσω, <i>I will</i>; λύσεις, <i>thou wilt</i>; λύσει, <i>he will</i>;
λύσομεν, <i>we will</i>; λύσετε, <i>ye will</i>; λύσουσι, <i>they will
loosen</i>. Of course by inserting this σ, a preceding consonant,
where the root is labial, uniting with it forms a ψ, as above in nouns
(<a href="#LESSON_4_3">Lesson IV, 3</a>); and in the same way, when
the final vowel of the root is a palatal the κ or γ appears as ξ—so,
from βλέπω, <i>I see</i>, βλέψω; from λέγω, <i>I say</i>, λέξω. But
there are several variations, which will be learned by practice; the
following are dominant:—
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">(α) Verbs with two consonants before the ω of
the present eject the latter before inserting the σ, so that the π or
φ of the root united with the σ becomes a ψ, as in τύπτω, τύψω; κόπτω,
<i>I cut</i>, κόψω; σκάπτω, <i>I dig</i>, σκάψω; γράφω, <i>I
write</i>, γράψω.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">(β) The same rule holds with many verbs in σσω,
Attic ττω, the root ending in κ or γ, as πράσσω, <i>I do</i>,
root πραγ, future πράξω; τάσσω, <i>I arrange</i>, τάξω.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">(γ) Verbs in άζω have either σω or ξω, or both,
as θαυμάζω, <i>I admire</i>, θαυμάσω; νυστάζω, <i>I nod</i>, άσω or
άξω; ἁρπάζω, <i>to carry off</i>, ξω, ἁρπάσομαι in Attic; βαστάζω,
<i>to carry</i>, βαστάσω.</p>

<p class="neg-indent space-below1">(δ) Pure verbs generally lengthen
the vowel of the present, α being changed into η, except where a vowel
or λ precedes the άω, as—</p>

boil</i>, ζέσω.</p>

<p class="neg-indent space-below1">(ε) Liquid verbs shorten the long
vowel of the root, or throw out the last of two consonants in the root,
and lay a circumflex accent on the termination ω, as—</p>

<p class="f120 space-below1"><span class="smcap">Infinitive Mood and Participles</span></p>

<p>The infinitive mood gives the action of the verb substantively as we
use the participle in <i>seeing is a good thing</i>, but in Greek, as
in Latin, always the infinitive, as καλὸν τὸ ὁρᾶν, and declined with
the article like a noun, through all the cases, of course neuter,
as the gender does not lie in the action, but in the actor. Its
normal ending in the active voice is ειν, as in the present βάλλειν,
<i>to throw</i>, and second aorist βαλεῖν; but in first aorist its
termination is αι, as κόψαι, from κόπτω. Pure verbs follow their vowel,
as τῑμᾶν, <i>to honour</i>; φιλεῖν, <i>to love</i>.</p>

<p>Like substantives, verbal infinitives are governed by prepositions
through all the cases, as περί, <i>about</i>; παρά, <i>from beside</i>;
μετά, <i>with</i>; ἐν, <i>in</i>, and εἰς <i>into</i>—as περὶ τοῦ
καπνίζειν λέγω μέτρον ἄριστον, <i>about smoking I say moderation is best</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>Participles are verbal adjectives declined as such, and signifying the
quality or accident of a certain state of being or action belonging to
an agent.</p>

<p class="space-below1">The participles of the present and of the
second aorist are declined in masculine and neuter according to the
type of the second declension, in feminine according to the first, as—</p>

<p class="f120 space-below1"><span class="smcap">Verbs in</span> <big>μι</big></p>

<p>The great mass of Greek verbs, whatever their variations of person
and tense may be, agree in this one prominent feature, that the first
person singular of the present indicative ends in ω, as in Latin
<i>ō</i>, possibly a relic of the pronoun ἐγώ, <i>I</i>. But there is a
small class of verbs in familiar use which, instead of the ω, affix to
the first person μι, evidently identical with the English <i>me</i> and
the German <i>mich</i>—a confusion of the nominative and accusative
cases familiar to our ears in French and vulgar English, when we say
<i>it is me</i> instead of <i>it is I</i>. Whatever may have been the
original form of the verbs in μι, as a matter of practice, if we fling
off the μι from the present, the future and the tenses cognate with it
may be formed directly from an assumed form in ω: thus ἵστημι, <i>I
cause to stand</i>, στήσω, <i>I will cause to stand</i>, as if from
στάω; τίθημι, <i>I place</i>, θήσω, <i>I will place</i>, as if from
θέω; δείκνῡμι, <i>I show</i>, δείξω, <i>I will show</i>, as if from
δείκω; and δίδωμι, <i>I give</i>, future δώσω, <i>I will give</i>, as
if from δόω, the Latin <i>dō</i> evidently preserving the simple form
from which δίδωμι comes by the prefix of δι and the suffix μι.</p>

<p>The middle and passive voice follow the form of the regular verb.</p>

<p>The perfect active of ἵστημι, ἕστηκα, is used as a present with a
neuter sense, <i>I stand</i>, and in like manner, the pluperfect
ἑστήκειν, and the 2nd aorist ἔστην, <i>I stood</i>.</p>

<p>τίθημι and its analogues have ε for the α in the plural, and first
aorist ἔθηκα instead of ἔθησα; and in the same way ἵημι, <i>to
send</i>, has first aorist ἧκα, <i>I sent</i>; so also δίδωμι has
ἔδωκα, <i>I gave</i>, not ἔδωσα.</p>

<p>The irregular verbs εἰμί, <i>I am</i>, εἶμι, <i>I go</i> (usually
future: <i>I will go</i>), evidently fall under this scheme. For εἰμί,
<i>I am</i>, <a href="#LESSON_I">see supra, Lesson I</a>. The verb
<i>to go</i> has εἶμι, <i>I go</i>; εἶ, <i>thou art going</i>; εἶσι,
<i>he is going</i>; ἴμεν, <i>we are going</i>; ἴτε, <i>you are
going</i>; ἴᾱσιν, <i>they are going</i>. Imperative ἴθι, <i>go</i>.</p>

<p>Verbs compounded with a preposition place the augment and reduplication
between the preposition and the verb. Except περὶ and πρὸ all
prepositions ending in a vowel have the vowel elided before the
augment; πρὸ generally forms a crasis with the augment and becomes

is resumed before the augment.

<p class="f120 space-below1"><span class="smcap">Moods:
Subjunctive and Conditional</span></p>

<p>The subjunctive or conjunctive mood is the form which the verb
takes when no independent assertion is made as a fact, but only as
a sequence of an asserted fact or truth, and having only a secondary
or conditional existence; as if I should say in English, <i>I give
you this, that it may be in your power to do so and so</i>, the
secondary sentence preceded by <i>that</i> is altogether dependent
on the precedent thing done, <i>I give you this</i>. In this example
the substantival proposition is in the present indicative, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
subjunctive nature of the dependent sentence is expressed by the
auxiliary verb <i>may</i>; but, if the leading clause is in the past
tense, the dependent clause is expressed by <i>might</i>, which in
fact is the past tense of <i>may</i>, as <i>I gave you this that you
might</i>. In Greek this past conditional is, from a peculiar usage,
commonly called the <i>optative mood</i>. In the present lesson we
shall confine ourselves to the dependent tense subjoined to a present
or a future. The form of the subjunctive is very simple, consisting as
it does in the mere change of the terminational vowel or diphthong of
the present into ω and η—</p>

<p class="space-below1">The optative mood, or subjunctive in a historic
sequence after a past tense, is distinguished by the domination of the
diphthong οι, and runs thus—

<p>And so in the second aorist, where there is one, as λάβοιμι, λάβοις,
λάβοι, etc., from λαμβάνω, <i>might, could, would</i>, or
<i>should get</i>.</p>

<p>In the first aorist the vowel α rules, and becomes αι, as singular,
βουλεύσαιμι, βουλεύσαις or ειας, βουλεύσαι or ειε; plural,
βουλεύσαιμεν, βουλεύσαιτε, βουλεύσαιεν or ειαν.</p>

<p>The most common uses of the optative may be classified thus—</p>

<div class="blockquot fontsize_110">
<p class="neg-indent">(1) In narrating what some one said, without
guaranteeing the fact; as if I should say in English, <i>he said that
he were going to do so</i>, instead of <i>was</i>; <i>e.g.</i>
ἔλεγεν ὅτι ἀνδρὶ νέῳ καὶ σφοδρῷ οὐ ῥᾴδιον εἴη κολάζειν τὰ πάθη,
<i>he said that it was not easy for a man young and vehement to
control his passions</i>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">(2) To express a purpose or consequence in past
time, with ὡς, ἵνα, or ὅπως, as ἐπόνει σταθερῶς ἵνα ἆθλον λάβοι, <i>he
laboured steadily that he might gain a prize</i>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">(3) After εἰ, <i>if</i>, to express an indefinite
future, generally with ἄν in the dependent clause, as εἴ τις αἵρεσίν
μοι δοίη, σπουδάζοιμι ἂν περὶ τὴν Ἑλληνικὴν γλῶσσαν μᾶλλον ἢ περὶ τὴν
Ἰταλικήν, <i>if one gave me the choice, I should prefer to study
Greek rather than Italian</i>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">(4) To express a wish (from which use the
name <i>optative</i> came), as μὴ γένοιτο, <i>may it not happen—God
forbid!</i></p>

in Greek with the past tenses, the imperfect or aorists, to express

<p class="f120 space-below1"><span class="smcap">The Middle Voice</span></p>

<p>The middle voice, or, as it might more significantly be called, the
reflexive or the subjective voice, is a form of the verb where the
action does not pass on from the agent to an outward object, but comes
back on him, or in some loose way is looked on as done for his benefit,
or affecting himself specially. Thus it is in the main identical with
what in Latin grammar used to be called neuter verbs, only it is
subject to not a few nice shades of personal reference, which leads to
its apparent confusion with the active voice, and to various anomalous
usages which can only be learned by practice. It is, of course, in
strictness more nearly allied to the passive than to the active voice;
for in both these voices, as distinguished from the active, the force
of the verb is either altogether spent on the agent, or is in some
way passively or emotionally or intentionally connected with him.
This intimate relationship leads to a similarity of form in the two
voices, the present and imperfect middle being in fact identical with
the same tenses in the passive voice, and the other tenses, in their
characteristic changes, more allied to the passive than to the active.</p>

<p class="f120 space-below1"><span class="smcap">Participles</span></p>

<p>The Greek participle has a large range of idiomatic and significant
usages, which can only be learned by reading. For a start, however,
it may be enough to say that the participle follows the leading
verb of the sentence in many cases where both Latin and English use
the infinitive, and that when joined with the definite article the
participle performs the function of a relative clause in a less
formal style; as if in English, instead of <i>the man who used such
language</i> is not a gentleman, we should say <i>the man the having
used</i>, which no doubt sounds very clumsy, because we require an
auxiliary verb to express the past participle, but in Greek ὁ ταῦτα
λέξας is manifestly neater and more succinct than ὃς ταῦτα ἔλεξε.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="APPENDIX_I">APPENDIX I</h2>
</div>

<p class="f120 space-below1"><span class="smcap">Elementary
Hints on Etymology</span></p>

<p>(1) In borrowed words, especially when the borrowing language, as
English, does not deal largely in sounding terminations, it is a common
practice to let the termination drop, either altogether or partly,
and leave only the simple root, as from λαμπάδα, <i>lamp</i>; from
δημοκρατία, <i>democracy</i>; from κακοφωνία, <i>cacophony</i>, and
other such feminines, as <i>theology</i>, <i>philology</i>, where the
α is dropped, and the accent transferred to the antepenultimate after
the favourite English fashion, while the German, more faithful to the
Greek, preserves the accented ι, and marks the presence of the α by an
<i>e</i>, as in <i>Theologié</i>, <i>Philologié</i>.</p>

<p>(2) As the Greek element in the English language often comes to us
not directly from the Greek, but indirectly through the Latin of the
Middle Ages, it sometimes happens that we find a pure Greek word with
a Latin termination attached to it naturalised in English, as in
<i>cathédral</i>, from καθέδρα, and in <i>ephemeral</i>, from ἐφήμερος.
In this example the termination <i>al</i>, so common in Latin, takes
the place of the Greek ος, with the same adjectival force; but in
not a few cases, as <i>optical</i>, <i>ethical</i>, <i>clinical</i>,
<i>political</i>, the <i>al</i> is an unmeaning superfluity, as
the adjectival character of the word is already fixed by the Greek
termination κος, as in κλινικός from κλίνη. In verbs the termination
<i>ate</i> is pure Latin, but appears sometimes barbarously appended to
a pure Greek verb, as <i>homologate</i>, from ὁμολογῶ.</p>

<p>(3) It is a general rule in etymology that cognate letters, that is,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
letters pronounced by the same organs, or a similar modification of the
vocal organs, easily pass into one another; thus σ and τ being both
dental, τ a pure dental, and σ a sibilant dental, and δ being only
the blunt form of τ, these three letters pass into one another, as in
Attic πράττω for πράσσω, and ῥόδον, English <i>rose</i>. So in German
<i>das</i> for English <i>that</i>. In like manner, λ and ρ being
both liquids, λείριον becomes <i>lily</i>, and the Latin <i>Tibur</i>
becomes the Italian <i>Tivoli</i>, by the interchange of the labials
and of the liquids.</p>

<p>(4) The termination <i>s</i> in the names of many of the sciences, as
<i>optics</i>, <i>acoustics</i>, <i>mechanics</i>, is simply the sign
of the plural in English, put for ά the neuter plural in Greek, as in
τὰ πολιτικά, <i>things belonging to the state</i>; τὰ ὀπτικά, <i>things
belonging to vision</i>, which, however, the Greeks often express by ἡ
ὀπτική in the nominative singular feminine, with τέχνη, <i>art</i>, or
θεωρία, <i>theory</i>, understood.</p>

<p>(5) The termination <i>ise</i> or <i>ize</i>, so common in English,
generally though not always with an active signification, as in
<i>advertise</i>, <i>solemnise</i>, is the ίζω of Greek, as in
σοφίζω, <i>I make wise</i>, with σοφίζομαι, in the middle voice,
<i>I profess myself wise</i>. The word σοφιστής from this verb, in
English <i>sophist</i>, is the person who makes this profession, as
in <i>baptist</i>, <i>theorist</i>, <i>atheist</i>, and other pure
Greek words for an agent, with only the loss of the termination ής;
sometimes in a hybrid way <i>ist</i> is added to a Latin root, as
in <i>deist</i>, etymologically but not colloquially identical with
<i>theist</i>.</p>

<p>(6) Sometimes not only is the terminational syllable cut off, but the
initial also, either wholly or in part; so ἐπίσκοπος, with the change
of π into the kindred labial β, becomes <i>bishop</i>.</p>

<p>(7) When two consonants of different kinship come together, one of
them, specially that not belonging to the root, disappears, as from
λάπτω, <i>lap</i>; from τύπτω, τύπος, <i>type</i>.</p>

<p>(8) The aspirate <i>h</i>, in Greek <i>spiritus asper</i>, has a
close affinity with the sibilant <i>s</i>; so for ἕξ we have in
Latin <i>sex</i>, in English <i>six</i>; ὗς for <i>sow</i>; ἕδος,
<i>sedes</i>, <i>seat</i>.</p>

<p>(9) When a word in Latin or Greek commences with a <i>p</i>, by
aspiration it becomes <i>f</i> in English and the Teutonic languages;
thus for πῦρ we have <i>fire</i>, for ποδ-<i>foot</i>, for πατήρ,
<i>father</i>, etc.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>(10) The English <i>w</i> is closely connected with the vowels, as
appears from <i>water</i> and <i>ooater</i>; hence it disappears in
Greek altogether, or is represented by a breathing, as in οἶνος,
<i>wine</i>; ὕδωρ, <i>water</i>; ὑετός, <i>wet</i>.</p>

<p>(11) In some adjectives the Latin <i>an</i>, like <i>al</i>,
is superfluously appended to the Greek termination in κός, as
<i>rhetorician</i>, from ῥητορικός.</p>

<p>(12) The Greek κ, as in κύων, and <i>cornu</i> in Latin, appears in the
Teutonic languages as <i>h</i>, so <i>hound</i>, <i>horn</i>; κολώνη,
<i>collis</i>, <i>hill</i>.</p>

<p>(13) The letter <i>m</i> at the end of an English word curtailed from
Greek signifies the thing done, the product of the verb, as ποίημα,
<i>poem</i>, the thing made, a poem, from ποιέω, <i>I make</i>;
so <i>baptism</i> from βαπτίζω, and <i>chrism</i> from χρίω, <i>I
anoint</i>, and other <i>isms</i>.</p>

<p>(14) Finally, as at least two-thirds of the technical words used in our
scientific nomenclature, and not a few even outside of the range, are
of Greek extraction, the student would act wisely if at starting he
were to make a list of all such terms in familiar use, with their Greek
form and Greek analysis in an opposite column; as—</p>

<table class="fontsize_120 no-wrap" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
  <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdr"><i>theology</i></td>
      <td class="tdl_ws1">θεολογία</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl">(θεός, <i>God</i>;</td>
      <td class="tdl_ws1">λόγος, <i>discourse</i>)</td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>He will thus find that he knows already some two or three hundred Greek
words in a slightly disguised English form.</p>

</div>

<p class="f150 space-below1"><b><span class="smcap">Vocabularies</span></b></p>

<p class="space-below2">In accordance with the principle set forth
in the preface, these vocabularies, containing the names of the most
familiar objects, are to be taken with him as a <i>vade mecum</i>
wherever the student goes. He must in no wise be content with the lazy
habit of recognising a word only in a passive recipient style when
he meets with it in a book, but he must stamp it directly on every
object that comes in his way, and repeat it frequently without the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
intervention of the mother tongue, till he uses it as familiarly as a
workman handles his tools. The language will thus become his familiar
friend, not, as in the mere bookish method, an occasional visitor. Of
course, such a catalogue of words is not intended to be exhaustive;
but the learner, after training himself to the habit of thinking and
speaking in the foreign idiom, may supply the deficiency by consulting
any good English-Greek dictionary, such as Arnold and Browne’s, London
1856, and for modern Greek, where that may be necessary, Lascarides’s
English-Greek dictionary, London 1882. From these sources also, and
from his own reading, which must in no wise be neglected, he will be
able to pick out appropriate verbs with which he may put the Hellenised
objects around him, so to speak, into motion, and hold a conversation
with a fellow-student trained to the colloquial method, or with himself,
solus cum solo, if he can find no partner in his colloquial exercise.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
